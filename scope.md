The purpose of this project is to show that I am able to use markdown in order to create a personal introductory webpage.

This project can be described as one of my first projects that will help me get used to using files on the github website.

The main outcomes that must be accomplished in the project inlcude:
- creating a subheading with my professional interests 
- writing two paragraphs describing my goals for the course
- completing an unordered list with three list items of my hobbies or interests 
- linking my github profile

An exlcusion I will make will be to leave out information about my family.
