<p>A certain goal I have for this course is to get better at coding. In order to achieve this goal I will watch youtube videos on how to code different kinds of files and by doing research on each topic. I already have an understanding for this subject from downloading mods on this same website for videogames. By achieving this goal I will become more proficient at using this website in order to make my files.</p>

<p>Another goal is using this class towards my career. By learning how to use this website, I will become better at coding which will help me if when I have to start using computers more often in the work force. Being able to identify scripts now will help me in the future when I need to use them for tasks that can be automated. I will be more experienced when using a work computer and will already have an understanding of how to implement features whenever I am told to.</p>
